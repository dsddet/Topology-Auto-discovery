-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco Configuration Professional (Cisco CP) is installed on this device. 

This feature requires the one-time use of the username "cisco" with the 

password "cisco". These default credentials have a privilege level of 15.

 

YOU MUST USE CISCO CP or the CISCO IOS CLI TO CHANGE THESE  

PUBLICLY-KNOWN CREDENTIALS



Here are the Cisco IOS commands.



username <myuser>  privilege 15 secret 0 <mypassword>

no username cisco



Replace <myuser> and <mypassword> with the username and password you want 

to use. 



IF YOU DO NOT CHANGE THE PUBLICLY-KNOWN CREDENTIALS, YOU WILL 

NOT BE ABLE TO LOG INTO THE DEVICE AGAIN AFTER YOU HAVE LOGGED OFF.

 

For more information about Cisco CP please follow the instructions in the 

QUICK START GUIDE for your router or go to http://www.cisco.com/go/ciscocp

Password: 

% Password expiration warning.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Cisco Configuration Professional (Cisco CP) is installed on this device 

and it provides the default username "cisco" for  one-time use. If you have 

already used the username "cisco" to login to the router and your IOS image 

supports the "one-time" user option, then this username has already expired. 

You will not be able to login to the router with this username after you exit 

this session.

 

It is strongly suggested that you create a new username with a privilege level 

of 15 using the following command.

 

username <myuser> privilege 15 secret 0 <mypassword>

 

Replace <myuser> and <mypassword> with the username and password you 

want to use.
